 # INFORMATION
Developed in particapation for YPS Game Jam 2024.
Solving the problem of scarcity of web3 integration plugins for RPG Maker MV Games.
Seriously this is only possible because someone made a workflow environment that
utilizes the latest technologies of NodeJS, ECMA Scripts, and RollupJS for usage
with RPGMakerMV which is at this point already starting to be replaced by RMMZ?
